      <h3>
Where I've lived</h3>

<p>Ive only ever been in Canada.  Although I've only ever lived in edmonton, but when I was young I lived in an apartmet.</p>

<h3>
What my life is like</h3>

<p>Every day I go to school, and enjoy my robotics, computer science, and math.  When school is finished I work out then go tho the gym built into the school.  After that I go home and play video games.  Generaly I don't get enough sleep.</p>
<h3>Why its so cold in Canada</h3>

<p> Because Canada is on the tip of the flat Earth and is almost falling so, the world decided it would spare it in exchange for cold forever and ever.</p>

<h3>
Does it ever get warm in Canada
</h3>

<p> sometimes when the world is extra happy with the amount of sacrafices we have provided it decides its time to reward us with a warmer closer to the sun, but as soon as we stop proiding sacrafices it decides its time to stop.</p>
